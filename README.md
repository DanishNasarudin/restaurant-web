# Project 1 - Restaurant Website

This is my first project after getting into React development.
The project is built upon combinations of tutorials I found online.

I had trouble implementing Sanity CMS as the tutorial and documentation available are not entirely great for Vite/React.
I refuse to switch to Next JS for this project, so I went ahead to try and solve it.
It was a success and I am planning to do a full guide for other dev that wants to implement Sanity CMS into Vite/React Projects.

## Sanity CMS Overview

Sanity does not provide the free option to create custom demo user. Hence, I will display them here as a preview.

The Sanity CMS is being access locally. No deployment from the Sanity Studio is required.
Routing has been set to redirect users into the Back-End CMS by using `/studio` within the main website link.

The Sanity CMS allow for customization of the dashboard as well. I've added a "Go To Website" button as a test sample.

I have implemented Sanity CMS with Preview Mode using React Router DOM. 

The Preview Mode will allow users to edit their content and preview before posting.

## Conclusion

The project took 2 weeks. I used 2-3 hours everyday to code and it was my very first react project.

I am able to understand how API calls are made. I had made sure to document every functions or boilerplates for anything I believe I would use again in the future.
This way, the next time I start a project, I can quickly establish the base layout of the functions I wanted to implement into the project.

Thank you for taking your time reviewing this project.
